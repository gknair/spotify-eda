The catchphrase **Data is the new currency** has become quite prevalent in our day to day conversations and news feed. As per the [statista reoprt]([https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) released in May 2020, this year, 2021, the world would consume 74 zettabytes (1 zettabyte = trillion gigabytes) of data worldwide. This number is projected to almost double in just 3 years by 2024.

Review: Add better transition from the previous paragraph before introducing the next section.

The fascinating thing about having data on subjects ranging from the absurd, squirrel census in Central Park, to the most arcane, dermatoscopic images, or even to the personal ,Whatsapp chats/location history, is that you can develop familiarity with an unfamiliar subject by following the data. Of course, you could also stumble upon new insights on familiar subjects too. 

Having said that, following data requires understanding the definition of data fields, the quality of the data and methodical analysis to arrive at the correct conclusions. To avoid getting lost in the state of an analysis paralysis, one should have a sense of the questions that need to be answered through data analysis. 

Exploratory data analysis primarily enable stakeholders to take data driven decisions 
and understand the interplays of various attributes that affect decisions.

This post, I would be using exploratory data analysis to understand to learn about the worldwide music interest using data from a global audio streaming service,Spotify. 
Some of the questions of interest are:

* how audio tracks on Spotify evolved over a century?
* what are the features associated with a particular track and their impact on popularity of a track?
* who's hot on Spotify?

Let's first get an overview of Spotify data and assess the quality of the same. 

# Overview of Spotify data

I have obtained all Spotify tracks ranging from 1920 to 2020 (100 years!) from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).  Each row ideally represents a track, with a Spotify track id, artist's name, track's name, and a bunch of audio features associated with the track. A sample of the data from year 2020 is shown below.


```{r}
datatable(
  head(
    data %>% 
      filter(year==2020)
    ), 
  rownames = FALSE, 
  options = list(dom = 'tp',
                 pageLength = 5,
                 scrollX = TRUE)
  )
```



## Data types

Review: Explain, type of variable before, using them. In general , refrain from using data fields or type of fields etc before introducing the concept. The audience might not know about this.

We have few categorical fields in the data like `id`, `name`, `artists`, `release_date`, and `key` that can take finite number of values. We also have many numerical fields, mostly the audio features, like `acousticness`, `danceability` etc., that can take infinite number of values within a defined range. Notice, that two fields - `mode` and `explicit` - are logical/binary in nature. 

## Data definitions

We now need to understand the definition of each field to then use them for our analyses. More specifically, I was interested to understand some definitions of audio features like `loudness`, `energy`, `danceability`, `popularity`, etc. I was also the most intrigued by the definition of `popularity` measure, which is derived from a Spotify algorithm that relies on number of plays a track has had and the recency of those plays.  The table below has the definitons of all the fields. 

```{r}
data_dict <- tibble("field" = names(data),
                    "definition" = c("Track unique id",
                                     "Track name",
                                     "Artist name",
                                     "Year the track was released",
                                     "Date the track was released",
                                     "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.",
                                     "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.",
                                     "Duration of the song in milliseconds",
                                     "Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.

                                     "If the track contains explicit content",

                                     "The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C#/Db, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.",

Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.",
                                     "Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.",

Review( Rephrase a) validation check;  )

After performing a validation check on the ideal state of this data (one record per track), certain issues appeared in terms of how it is curated. There were few records where all the fields were duplicated multiple times. Moreover, a track can be added to Spotify as a single entry and/or as a part of an album with separate ids for each addition. The same track can also be added multiple times with different release dates under different licenses and in different markets. Therefore, we need to overcome this issue in the data to not double count the statistics which can mislead our conclusions.

One way to tackle this issue is to define the track as a combination of an artist and a track name and keep the one that was released the earliest. For example, **Rain On Me (with Ariana Grande)** track has two entries in the data with release dates of `r format(as.Date("2020-05-22"), "%b %d %Y")` and `r format(as.Date("2020-05-29"), "%b %d %Y")` from which we would choose the one released on `r format(as.Date("2020-05-22"), "%b %d %Y")`. By following this logic, we will not be favoring the popularity measure (correlated with recent number of plays) for any track that could have same track + artist combination released across various years with varying popularity measures. 

After cleaning the data, we now have total of **158,581** tracks - a reduction of ~14,000 records with duplicate entries. 

```{r}
datatable(
  data %>%
    filter(name=="Rain On Me (with Ariana Grande)"),
  rownames = FALSE,
  options = list(dom = 'tp',
                 pageLength = 5, 
                 scrollX = TRUE)
  )
```


```{r}
key_map <- rev(c("0" = "C", "1" = "C#", "2" = "D", "3" = "D#", "4" = "E", "5" = "F", "6" = "F#", "7" = "G", "8" = "G#", "9" = "A", "10" = "A#", "11" = "B"))

data_prc <- data %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  #select(-id, -release_date) %>% # duplicate records for different ids and release date
  distinct() %>%
  # same song with same artist have multiple records with slight changes in audio featues and year
  arrange(name, artists, year, release_date) %>% 
  group_by(name, artists) %>%
  filter(id==min(id)) %>%
  #filter(popularity == max(popularity)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
   mutate(popularity_category = ifelse(popularity >= 80, "80+", "<80"),
          valence_bin = cut(valence, seq(0,1,0.1), right = FALSE),
          duration_min = duration_ms/(1000*60),
          mode_type = case_when(mode==0 ~ "minor",
                                mode==1 ~ "major"),
          key_str = as.character(key),
          key_group = str_replace_all(key_str, key_map))

# Evolution of Spotify music

We have a fair understanding of the data and have processed it appropriately. Let's observe some trends!

## Tracks and artists over years on Spotify

The number of tracks released on Spotify fluctuates a lot between 1920 and 1950, probably becuase of the limited capacity for production. Since 1950, around 2,000 tracks were released consistently until 1999. The number dropped by almost a half in 2000-2001 and is steadily increasing since 2004.  Interestingly, the number of tracks shot up by 1.5 in 2020. I am reigning my temptation to associate reasons with the high level fluctuations in number of tracks over years since Spotify has not been the most exhaustive platform to host all the music that gets created across the century. However, the trends are certainly intriguing and demands further understanding and investigation of the data.   

The number of unique artists who released tracks by years has an increasing trend across all years, including the years when number of tracks were stable around 2,000.    


```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(tracks = n(),
            artists = n_distinct(artists)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = tracks, color = "tracks")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = tracks, color = "tracks")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = artists, color = "artists")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = artists, color = "artists")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("tracks" = "#8d52eb", "artists" = "#ec576c")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(y = "tracks vs artists")
)

```

## Popularity over years on Spotify

The mean popularity has gone down since 2000 while the maximum popularity has been on the rise since 2000 suggesting that despite having more tracks in the recent years, not all gained higher popularity. 2020 recorded the highest maximum popularity score of 96 out of 100. This also could be partly because of the method of popularity calculation which weighs more on number of plays from the recent time period. Therefore, making the tracks released in the recent years more popular.   

```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean_popularity = mean(popularity),
            max_popularity = max(popularity)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_popularity, color = "mean_popularity")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_popularity, color = "mean_popularity")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = max_popularity, color = "max_popularity")) +
  geom_point(aes(y = max_popularity, color = "max_popularity")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("mean_popularity" = "#aaf6b1", "max_popularity" = "#019875")) +
  labs(y = "mean and max popularity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        legend.title = element_blank())
)

```


### Anatomy of the most popular track(s)

Who does not enjoy popularity? Let's see if we can find the secret behind the most popular track on Spotify. 

There are two most popular tracks released in 2020 that gained popularity of 96 - **positions** by _Ariana Grande_ and **Mood (feat. iann dior)** by _24kGoldn_. 

Both the tracks are on the higher end of valence (happy mood), energy, and danceability. Both have explicit content present and have 0 instrumentalness. **Positions** is set in a major mode while the other is set in a minor mode. 

Can we conclude from these two tracks that having high energy, danceability, and explicit content is the key to higher popularity? Probably we can analyze further. 

 
```{r fig.dim=c(10,10)}
audio_features <- c("acousticness", "danceability", "duration_min", "energy", "instrumentalness", "explicit", "liveness", "loudness", "key", "mode", "speechiness", "tempo", "valence")

ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  filter(popularity==max(popularity)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(audio_features), names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = feature_value, fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~feature_name, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
)

```


We will investigate the recipe of popularity further in a little bit. Before that, let's check out the trends in audio features over 100 years. You might have noticed that all the audio features have different scales. For example, loudness ranges from 0 (most loud) to -60 (least loud) while popularity ranges from 0 to 100. Therefore, to compare them on a standard scale, we need to normalize their numerical values between a standard range, say 0 to 1. 

## Evolution of audio features

The average acousticness has drastically reduced over the years, probably because of the inventions of more electronic instruments. The average energy of tracks has drmamatically increased over the years, almost at the same time acousticness started reducing. Could there be a correlation there? 

The average loudness of the tracks has slightly increased. The average valence has slightly decreased on the other hand. Instrumentalness was more present in earlier years although there has been an uptick in the recent years for the same. 

```{r}
rescale <- function(x) (x-min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))
scales_data_prc <- data_prc %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~rescale(.)) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

```{r}
audio_features_2 <- c("acousticness", "danceability", "energy", "instrumentalness", "liveness", "loudness", "speechiness", "tempo", "valence")
ggplotly(
  scales_data_prc %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = all_of(audio_features_2), names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  group_by(year, feature_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_feature_value = mean(feature_value)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_feature_value, color = feature_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")
)

```


We need to analyze trends for audio features that are either logical or categorical separately becuase taking an average for them would not be appropriate. 

### Major/minor mode

There has been more tracks set in minor mode in recent years. Generally speaking, minor mode tracks tend to have sad/gloomhy mood. This is in alignmnet with decreasing valence in the recent years.  

```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  count(year, mode_type) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(perc_tracks = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = perc_tracks, fill = mode_type, group = 1)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10))
)

```


### Explicit content

Percentage of tracks with explicit conent has been increasing since 1980s with two peaks around 2000 and 2018. 

```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  count(year, explicit) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  mutate(perc_tracks = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = perc_tracks, fill = factor(explicit))) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10))
)

```

<!-- # key -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- data_prc %>% -->
<!--   count(year, key_group) %>% -->
<!--   group_by(year) %>% -->
<!--   mutate(perc = n/sum(n)) %>% -->
<!--   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = perc, fill = key_group)) + -->
<!--   geom_col() + -->
<!--   scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") + -->
<!--   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Duration of tracks

Average duarion of the tracks in minutes has been fluctuating between 4 to 4.5 minutes since 1970. Spotify has collected **`r round(sum(data_prc$duration_min)/(60*24*365), 2)`** years worth of tracks over 100 years!! If you would rather not spend that much time listening to each and every song but dance on the most "danceable" song, get wild listening to **Funky Cold Medina** by _Tone-Loc_. 

```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean_dur = mean(duration_min)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_dur)) +
  geom_line(color = "#800000") + geom_point(color = "#800000") +
  labs(y = "mean duration (mins)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1910, 2020, 10))
)

```

# Correlation of audio features

Plotting the trends of audio features over years and analyzing audio features of the most popular tracks invoked some curiosity around the correlation of these features among themselves and with the popularity measure. 

Below graph shows corrleation of each audio feature with other audio features. Note that mode and key are excluded from this matrix as they are kind of categorical variables.  Colors closer to orange showcase higher positive correlation, colors closer to purple showcase no correlation, while colors closer to dark blue show negative correlation.  It is quite trivial to point out that each audio feature is correlated to itself with 100% positive correlation. 

Energy is negatively correlated with acousticness which aligns with what we observed in the trends earlier. Energy increased at the same time acousticness decreased. 

Loudness is highly correlated with energy which makes loudness negatively correlated with acousticness as well. 

Danceability is positively correlated with valence of the track, not surprising!

Popularity is negatively correlated with acousticness, instrumentalness, and speechiness while positively correlated with loudness and energy. 


```{r}
ggplotly(
  melt(cor(data_prc %>%
      select(c(audio_features_2, "popularity")))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#003366", high = "orange", mid = "purple") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(x = "", y = "")
)

```

Another intersting factor affecting popularity is presence of explicit content in tracks. Since it is a logical variable, plotting the popularity distribution by each value of `explicit` field is more appropriate to find out its impact on popularity.  The violin chart below shows the density of popularity distribution in the vertical direction while the horizontal lines show 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile of the distribution. 75% of tracks with explicit content had popularity of no more than 65 while 75% of tracks without explicit content had popularity of no more than 42. This gives a slight hint of more explicit content being more popular. 

```{r}
data_prc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(explicit), y = popularity)) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) +
  labs(x = "explicit content")
```


Some of the above mentioned correlation observations are visualized in one chart below to fit linear trends. Such correlation plots could be very useful to understand the importance of each feature in predicting a variable, for example popularity. 

It seems that tracks with more energy, loudness, explicit content and less instrumentalness, acousticness tend to be more popular. After all, this conclusion is not very far from our earlier conclusion on popularity from the most popular tracks. 

```{r}
p_acoustic <- data_prc %>%
  mutate(acoustic_bin = cut(acousticness, seq(0,1.1,0.0001), right = FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(acoustic_bin) %>%
  summarise(mean_popularity = mean(popularity),
         mean_acoustic = mean(acousticness)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_acoustic, y = mean_popularity)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = str_glue("correlation = {round(cor(data_prc$acousticness, data_prc$popularity),2)}"))

```

```{r}

  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = str_glue("correlation = {round(cor(data_prc$energy, data_prc$loudness),2)}"))
```


```{r}
p_valence_dance <- data_prc %>%
  mutate(dance_bin = cut(danceability, seq(0,1,0.0001), right = FALSE)) %>%
  group_by(dance_bin) %>%
  summarise(mean_valence = mean(valence),
         mean_dance = mean(danceability)) %>%

```

# Top 20 most productive artists

After visualizing trends and correlation of audio features, let's find out which artists have been the most productive on Spotify 100 years. 

The chart below shows top 20 artists that released the most number of songs on Spotify. The shading represents time between release of their first track and last track. Top 4 most productive artists by a bigger margin have been active for < 30 years between 1920 to 1950. Higher number of active years may have some correlation with popularity as they could consistently release tracks over many years and those tracks have been played more times in recent times. **Ella Fitzgerald** is one of the early artists (from 1920s) whose last track was added in 1999 yet ranks pretty high on the popularity spectrum (73). Quite incredible! **Frank Sinatra** has been active for most amount of years (80 years) among the top 20 artists. 

I could not resist but notice our beloved **Lata Mangeshkar ji's** name sitting nicely between **The Beatles** and **Queeen**. 

```{r}
ggplotly(
  data_prc %>%
  group_by(artists) %>%
  summarise(n_songs = n(),
            first_activity = min(year),
            last_activity = max(year)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(years_active = last_activity - first_activity + 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_songs)) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(artists, n_songs), y = n_songs, fill = years_active)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "artist", x = "tracks") +
  coord_flip()
)
```

Let's quickly go through audio features of the tracks by few well known artists. 

## Audio features of tracks by Lata Mangeshkar

The most popular song of Lata Mangeshkar on Spotify is **Aaj Phir Jeene Ki Tamanna Hai** released in 1965. Below chart shows that her tracks are on the high spectrum of acousticness (not surprising). Danceability is in the medium range. Her tracks on Spotify are mostly on the higher end of valence. Since Spotify might have limited tracks from this prolific artist, it might be best to no conclude anything in particular.  

```{r}
# data_prc %>%
#   filter(artists=="['Lata Mangeshkar']") %>%
#   arrange(desc(popularity))

ggplotly(
  scales_data_prc %>%
  filter(artists=="['Lata Mangeshkar']") %>%
  pivot_longer(audio_features_2, names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = feature_name, y = feature_value, color = feature_name)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.4) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")
)

```


## Audio features of tracks by few other popular artists

**The Beatles**: The most popular song recorded on Spotify is **Come Together - Remastered 2009** with popularity score of 78

**Queen**: The most popular song recorded on Spotify is **Don't Stop Me Now - Remastered 2011** with popularity score of 73

**Coldplay**: The most popular song recorded on Spotify is **Yellow** with popularity score of 85

Below is their anatomy of audio features. 

**The Beatles** and **Queen** are not too different from each other in terms of their audio feature profile. **Coldplay** is high on loudness, medium on danceability, and low on valence. 

```{r}
# data_prc %>%
#   filter(artists=="['The Beatles']") %>%
#   arrange(desc(popularity))

ggplotly(scales_data_prc %>%
  filter(artists=="['The Beatles']") %>%
  pivot_longer(audio_features_2, names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = feature_name, y = feature_value, color = feature_name)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  labs(title = "The Beatles"))
```


```{r}
# data_prc %>%
#   filter(artists=="['Queen']") %>%
#   arrange(desc(popularity))

ggplotly(scales_data_prc %>%
  filter(artists=="['Queen']") %>%
  pivot_longer(audio_features_2, names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = feature_name, y = feature_value, color = feature_name)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(title = "Queen"))


```



```{r}
# data_prc %>%
#   filter(artists=="['Coldplay']") %>%
#   arrange(desc(popularity))

ggplotly(scales_data_prc %>%
  filter(artists=="['Coldplay']") %>%
  pivot_longer(audio_features_2, names_to = "feature_name", values_to = "feature_value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = feature_name, y = feature_value, color = feature_name)) +
  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
  labs(title = "Coldplay"))
```

One question that came to mind while exploring the data is what can the most commonly used words across all tracks tell us about the core inspiration of music. 

# Common words in track names

Top 100 words from 100 years have **love** and **live** as the most common words in all track names after excluding commonly used words like _a/an/the/you/me/I/mixed/remaster_ etc. and years. I wonder which **live** - the verb or the noun - has been used the most commonly in track names. One could dissect the keyword **live** by the `liveness` audio feature to get a better distinction or it might require another blog on sentiment analysis. For now, let's wish it is live - the verb. 

As a side note, I also checked the most commonly used word by each year from 1990 and **love** appeared for most of the years. Love never looses!

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Top 100 words over 100 years", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/word-cloud-100.JPG")
```

It is quite interesting to see words related to work out as more common words in tracks of 2020. 


```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Top 100 words in 2020", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./imgs/word-cloud-100-2020.JPG")
```


I Hope you had some of your musical and analytical curiosiry satisfied through this blog. As an avid listener of Indian classical and pop music, I got a good introduction to music and artists from other genres. I am certainly going to listen to tracks from all 20 most productive artists, specially **Ella Fitzgerald** and the most popular tracks ever recorded on Spotify **positions** and **Mood (feat. iann dior)**.   

Have a lovely day!
